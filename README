1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The "Data::Str2Num" module extends the Perl language (the system).

    The "Data::Str2int" module translates an scalar string to a scalar
    integer. Perl itself has a documented function, '0+$x', that converts a
    scalar to so that its internal storage is an integer (See p.351, 3rd
    Edition of Programming Perl). If it cannot perform the conversion, it
    leaves the integer 0. Surprising not all Perls, some Microsoft Perls in
    particular, may leave the internal storage as a scalar string.

    The "str2int" function is basically the same except if it cannot perform
    the conversion to an integer, it returns an "undef" instead of a 0.
    Also, if the string is a decimal or floating point, it will return an
    undef. This makes it not only useful for forcing an integer conversion
    but also for testing a scalar to see if it is in fact an integer scalar.

  1.3 Document overview.

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests

    *   Write a program to build a matrix to trace test step to the
        requirements and vice versa by parsing the *# R: * comments.
        Automatically insert the matrix in the Test::TestUtil POD.
