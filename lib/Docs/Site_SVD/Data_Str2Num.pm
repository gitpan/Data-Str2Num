 Software Version Description

 for

 Data::Str2Num - convert a scalar string to an integer

 Revision: B

 Version: 0.03

 Date: 2003/07/27

 Prepared for: General Public

 Classification: NONE

=head1 1.0 SCOPE

This paragraph identifies and provides an overview
of the released files.

=head2 1.1 Identification

This release,
identified in L<3.2|/3.2 Inventory of software contents>,
is a collection of Perl modules that
extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

=head2 1.2 System overview

The "L<Data::Str2Num|Data::Str2Num>" module extends the Perl language (the system).

The "Data::Str2int" module translates an scalar string to a scalar integer.
Perl itself has a documented function, '0+$x', that converts a scalar to
so that its internal storage is an integer
(See p.351, 3rd Edition of Programming Perl).
If it cannot perform the conversion, it leaves the integer 0.
Surprising not all Perls, some Microsoft Perls in particular, may leave
the internal storage as a scalar string.

The "str2int" function is basically the same except if it cannot perform
the conversion to an integer, it returns an "undef" instead of a 0.
Also, if the string is a decimal or floating point, it will return an undef.
This makes it not only useful for forcing an integer conversion but
also for testing a scalar to see if it is in fact an integer scalar.

=head2 1.3 Document overview.

Change the test so that test support program modules resides in distribution
directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory. 
Because they are no longer in the lib directory, 
test support files will not be installed as a pre-condition for the 
test of this module.
The test of this module will precede immediately.
The test support files in the tlib directory will vanish after
the installtion.

including not only the GO paths but also what to

Add the requirements addressed as I<# R: >
