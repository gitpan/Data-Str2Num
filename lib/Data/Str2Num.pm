=head1 NAME

Data::Str2int - convert a scalar string to an integer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Data::Str2Num;

 $integer = Data::Str2Num->str2int($str)


 use Data::Str2Num qw(str2int);

 $integer = str2int($str)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The "Data::Str2Num" module translates an scalar string to a scalar integer.
Perl itself has a documented function, '0+$x', that converts a scalar to
so that its internal storage is an integer
(See p.351, 3rd Edition of Programming Perl).
If it cannot perform the conversion, it leaves the integer 0.
Surprising not all Perls, some Microsoft Perls in particular, may leave
the internal storage as a scalar string.

The "str2int" function is basically the same except if it cannot perform
the conversion to an integer, it returns an "undef" instead of a 0.
Also, if the string is a decimal or floating point, it will return an undef.
This makes it not only useful for forcing an integer conversion but
also for testing a scalar to see if it is in fact an integer scalar.

Coming soon.

=head1 DEMONSTRATION

 ~~~~~~ Demonstration overview ~~~~~

Perl code begins with the prompt

 =>

The selected results from executing the Perl Code 
follow on the next lines. For example,

 => 2 + 2
 4

 ~~~~~~ The demonstration follows ~~~~~

 =>     use File::Package;
 =>     my $fp = 'File::Package';

 =>     my $s2n = 'Data::Str2Num';
 =>     my $loaded;
 => my $errors = $fp->load_package($s2n)
 => $errors
 ''

 => $s2n->str2int('033')
 '27'

 => $s2n->str2int('0xFF')
 '255'

 => $s2n->str2int('0b1010')
 '10'

 => $s2n->str2int('255')
 '255'

 => $s2n->str2int('hello')
 undef


=head1 QUALITY ASSURANCE

The module "t::Data::Str2Num" is the Software
Test Description(STD) module for the "Data::Str2Num".
module. 

To generate all the test output files, 
run the generated test script,
run the demonstration script and include it results in the "Data::Str2Num" POD,
execute the following in any directory:

 tmake -test_verbose -replace -run  -pm=t::Data::Str2Num

Note that F<tmake.pl> must be in the execution path C<$ENV{PATH}>
and the "t" directory containing  "t::Data::Str2Num" on the same level as the "lib" 
directory that contains the "Data::Str2Num" module.
